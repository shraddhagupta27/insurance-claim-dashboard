# Insurance & Claims Analysis Dashboard 
A Power BI dashboard that analyzes insurance policy and claims data to uncover high-risk customer segments, claim frequency patterns, and underwriting insights.

## Overview
This project delivers an end-to-end insurance analytics dashboard that consolidates policyholder demographics, vehicle attributes, and claims information into a unified reporting layer. The dashboard enables underwriting, claims, and pricing teams to evaluate portfolio performance, assess risk segments, and identify trends that influence claim severity and frequency.

## Problem Statement

Insurance companies often struggle with fragmented policy and claims data, making it difficult to answer key business questions such as: Which customer or vehicle segments generate the highest claim amounts? How do demographic factors (age, gender, education, marital status) influence claim frequency? Which coverage zones or car makes present higher risk exposures? How do policies vary across regions and customer groups? To solve this, a centralized analytics dashboard was built in Power BI to bring all data elements together and provide actionable insights.

## Dataset

The dataset includes policyholder and claims data with attributes such as: Customer demographics, Vehicle attributes, Geographical fields, Policy information, Claim details:
